<h1><b>WELCOME<b></h1>
<p>Uhh, yeah. This is the place you are looking for.</p>

<p>I honestly do not know what to put here, so I guess I'll just say what's on my mind.</p>

<p>Disco Elysium meant a lot to me. But not in the way you might think. When I first played it, I found it a confusing and incoherent mess. I didn't have the kind of background knowledge or political understanding to truly appreciate the message it was trying to send. And yet, I was enthralled by the game, because even back then, I knew that even though I didn't enjoy it, Disco Elysium is a rare piece of art.</p>

<p>It isn't until years later when I decided to replay it when I finally understood what it was trying to say. I remember being ridiculed for being a Moralist in my first playthrough, and I reveled being ridiculed for being a Communist in my second one. I remember being mocked for being a Sorry Cop in my first playthrough, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching Kim's exasperation as I screamed about the apocalypse on the second one.</p>

<p>But the thing that struck me the most in both playthroughs is how horrible Martinaise is. Not in the sense that the people are bad. In fact, most people, even the ones that seemed antagonistic at first, are good people. They're just stuck with horrible living conditions and any other side effects that come with being born in basically nowhere. When I spouted out the most extreme Communist ideologies known to man, the people thought I was crazy, and rightfully so. But that path I took really highlighted the disatisfaction within the people of Martinaise in the current system. Even when they aren't saying anything, you can see that every single person knows that the world can't just go on like this. An unwavering determination to survive and see that <i>something</i> has to change. </p>

<p>And I only really appreciated that in my second playthrough, when I became more aware of how shitty this world really is. It's only after I played Disco Elysium for the second time when I realised that no matter how much it seems like you're being mocked, like Harry was when he went around spreading Communism, there are still a lot of people out there who aren't satisfied with how the world is. Change <i>will</i> come. Because things just can't go on like this.

<p> I guess what I'm trying to say is...</p>
